                    Childhood Exposure
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Back when I was 11 years old, I actually got hired at a Startup who paid
                    in LOS (Lines of code), they coded in C# and I knew NOTHING about how hard
                    coding was especially using C#. <br>

                    I remember a James Fleming, who was a Retired sargeant in the US military,
                    introduced me to Teamviewer to give me Videos on Data Structures and
                    Algorithms and C#, dont remember the rest and im sure the Startup was called,
                    "Thoucurator", focused on Game Developement. <br>

                    my first IDE was Visual Basic, and the only code that I could muster was 'main'.
