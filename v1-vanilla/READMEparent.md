Using Svelte as a framework

To be hosted on Vercel

## Setup

Project was created by doing what is shown on this code snippet: // Only done once by project maker, you shouldn't do this.

```
cd /clone/dir/
npm create svelte@latest v2-framework
cd v2-framework
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

To run the server yourself and then open the app in a browser, do this:

```
cd /clone/dir/v2-framework
```
