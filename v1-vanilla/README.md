## Color Schemes

A dark theme should avoid using saturated colors

baseline Material Design dark theme uses the 200 tone of the primary color

A secondary color can be used to accent select parts of your UI. In a dark theme, a secondary color can be desaturated to meet the 4.5:1 contrast level.

In a dark theme, dark surfaces occupy the majority of the UI. Accent colors are typically light (desaturated pastels) or bright (saturated, vivid color) to help accented elements stand out. They should be used sparingly to accent key elements, such as text or buttons.
