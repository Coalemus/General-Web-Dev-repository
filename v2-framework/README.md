Using Svelte as a framework

Hosted in Netlify

## Setup

Project was created by doing what is shown on this code snippet: // Only done once by project maker, you shouldn't do this.

```
cd /clone/dir/
npm create svelte@latest v2-framework
cd v2-framework
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

To run the server yourself and then open the app in a browser, do this:

```
cd /clone/dir/v2-framework
```

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
