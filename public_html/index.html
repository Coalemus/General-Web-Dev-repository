                    <span>Back when I was 11 years old, I actually got hired at a Startup who paid
                    in LOS (Lines of code), they coded in C# and I knew NOTHING about how hard
                    coding was especially using C#. </span>

                    <span>I remember James Fleming, who was a Retired sargeant in the US military,
                    introduced me to Teamviewer to give me Videos on Data Structures and
                    Algorithms and C#, dont remember the rest and im sure the Startup was called,
                    "Thoucurator", focused on Game Developement. </span> 

                    <span>my first IDE was Visual Basic, and the only code that I could muster was 'main'.</span>

                        I decided to be a computer scientist when my idea to become a Doctor was scrapped
                        because of the Pandemic. It is my hobby anyway so it works out fine. Got a decent
                        smartphone handed down that could run the majority of apps in a non-frustrating
                        matter and that helped a lot.

                        Early 2020, I started learning using Sololearn during commutes and slowly hoarding bookmarks and 
                        ebooks for programming. I finally focused on practicing coding projects
                        as a hobby and the timing was just right that I got handed down a laptop.
